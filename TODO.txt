 Pre-release:
Make an icon.

 Would be nice:
If we've received a BADTIME response then disable scrobbling and re-enable it after the time has been updated.
Replace the margins around the web links with padding in order to give them more area and make them easier to tap.
Add time of last scrobble to UI.
Love/ban/skip.
Replace magic strings with constants so that they can be refactored easily.
Make it so that when scrobbling is disabled we still keep track of what's going, but just don't enqueue.
Check UI with QVGA resolution.
Support for the getting metadata automatically from the device's Video MediaStore.
